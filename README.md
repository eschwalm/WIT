## Bonus features:

* Answers can be up-voted
* Answers are displayed in order of upvotes
* Users build clout from up-voted answers

## Technologies and Technical Challenges
* MongoDB
* Express.js
* React Native
* Node.js
* Cloudinary for image hosting

## Things accomplished over the weekend
* We had to scrap our iOS Swift Augmented Reality app project Sunday evening as it didn’t seem feasible enough, so we have a little catching up to do still. But we have decided on features and technologies, and a work outline.

## Group Members and Work Breakdown
Group members are Priya Gurung, Lisa Togler, Evan Schwalm

We will all:
* Discuss project planning and more specific task breakdowns at the beginning and end of each day.
* Use our repo's Issues tab to collect bugs and assign tasks.
* Research technologies and libraries to use for the project as we go and see fit.
* Think about overall look, layout and design (front-end design).
